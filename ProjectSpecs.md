# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS and RUBRIC

## Creativity
 - The primary purpose of a "freelance" project is to take what you have learned in the related walkthrough and make it your own.
 - In this project you are asked to do the following:
     - Adapt your own "theme" to this image gallery.  Hawaii was the theme adapted in the walk-through.
     - Maintain the identical structure from the ImageGallery walk-through project as stated in General Specifications below
     - Select your own colors / color palette
     - Select your own font(s)
     - Include a minimum of nine images that directly relate to your theme.
     - Your images should be stored in the "assets" folder.  The turtle image from the walkthrough is here simply to establish the folder and is NOT to be        used in this project
     - Adhere to any and all copyright concerns
     - If you own the images, your "cardText" class can be used for an image caption and description
     - Add one additional CSS image feature when the user "hovers" their cursor over a photo
     - Follow [Front-End Design Rules](https://metapress.com/top-5-front-end-design-rules-for-developers/) or [Principles of Good Web Design](https://www.feelingpeaky.com/9-principles-of-good-web-design/)
 - This project will be published on the internet using GitHub pages (as demonstrated in the walk-through) and thus should be appropriate for public viewing and your educational institution's representation

## Time and Classroom Management
 - This project is meant to be completed during scheduled class time only - working "bell to bell"

 - Instructor assistance is sought when appropriate to avoid overextending time
